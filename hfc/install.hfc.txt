 SPoCA code is dedicated to detected ACTIVE REGIONS and CORONAL HOLES
 on EUV images.
 The code is developped and maintained by the Belgian SIDC SDO Data Center (SSDC).
 More information about SPoCA and SSDC can be found in http://sdoatsidc.oma.be/web/sdoatsidc/LatestNews.

 To retrieve the latest SPoCa code, contact the SPoCA developpers. 
 
 Once SPoCA source files are on your local disk, you must compiled C++ (.cpp) files to 
 create executables (.x). 
 To do this, follow instructions provided in the INSTALLATION text file.

 To set up the SPOCA HFC environment variables, please use the shell scripts 
 in the scripts directory.

 To run SPoCA executables for the HFC purpose, use the scripts files provided
 in the sub-directory hfc/prod/scripts.
