 GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 The directory /hfc contains all of the programs to launch and run the 
 SPOCA code for the HFC. It stores two folders:
	
	/devtest	dev. version of the SPOCA HFC library
	
	/prod 		stable version of the SPOCA HFC library


 LAUNCHING SPOCA 

 All of the scripts to run SPoCA can be found in the /scripts sub-directories.
 Before launching a script be sure that the spoca code is correclty installed
 (see install.txt), and that paths and environmment variables are correctly
 defined. 

 Especially, for slurm scripts you must define input options to provide
 to the cluster/grid (e.g., Time of computation, Memory required, etc)
 in the header of the file. See http://dio.obspm.fr/Calcul/tycho/ for 
 more explanations about job submission (in french).

 To run a bash script, enter : bash name_of_the_script.sh
 To run a slurm script, enter: qsub name_of_the_script.slurm

 To see the status of the job, enter: squeue
