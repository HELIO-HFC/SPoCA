# SPoCA
Automated detection code for solar active region and coronal holes on EU images.

About SPoCA
===========

The Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA) produces a segmentation of EUV solar images into regions named here `classes' corresponding to Active Regions (AR), Coronal Holes (CH), and the Quiet Sun (QS). SPoCA uses a multi-channel unsupervised spatially-constrained fuzzy clustering procedure, where the classes are determined by minimization of intra-class variance. 

The SPoCA code is developed and maintained by the SIDC SDO Data Centre at the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB). Visit http://sdoatsidc.oma.be/web/sdoatsidc/SoftwareSPoCA for more details about the SPoCA code.

IMPORTANT: This repository only contains the SPoCA wrapper for the Heliophysics Feature Catalogue (HFC). Please contact the SPoCA team at SIDC SDO Data Centre to get the algorithm code source.
